            Hello there, I am <span className="text-main-color">Hamza Outmassint</span>, a full-stack developer with a proficiency in both back-end and front-end development.
            My passion lies in crafting robust and efficient web applications. On the back-end, I possess advanced skills in PHP,
            particularly with Laravel framework, SQL (MySQL), and MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to the front-end, I shine with proficiency in JavaScript,
            ReactJS, and Redux, empowering me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Additionally, I am well-versed in popular CSS frameworks
            like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, as well as Sass, allowing me to craft visually appealing and responsive designs.
          </p>
